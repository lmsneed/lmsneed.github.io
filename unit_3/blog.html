<h7>What is the typical cost of your events?</h7> 

<h4>It is almost impossible to give a typical cost without knowing the details of your event.  Pricing depends on many factors, including:
 
Guest count, type of function, length of event, range of services needed, location, type of food service you would like, other services such as floral, lighting, entertainment, rental choices and so on, and of course your budget.  We design each event individually, and while we are not on the inexpensive end of catering, we try to give great value for our services, whilst being mindful of your budget. </h4>

<h7>Do you have a minimum guest count? </h7>

<h4>Our events typically range anywhere from 50 to 2,500 guests, though, occasionally we work with smaller or larger groups.</h4>

<h7>How early should we book your services?</h7> 
 
<h4>Many of our events are booked a couple of months to one year in advance.  We can often accommodate last minute bookings though, especially midweek.  For weddings, we do tend to get booked up many months in advance, especially during the summer and fall weekends, but we love to help out with weddings with very little planning time.   Holiday parties also tend to get booked quite early, as the best venues are usually fully booked earlier than for regular events.</h4>
 
<h7>Do you work with Non Profit Groups?</h7>
 
<h4>Yes we do.  We have non profit rates, and we really enjoy working with groups whose causes we celebrate too.  Please call Jane to talk about your event.</h4>
